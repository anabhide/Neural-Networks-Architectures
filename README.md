# Neural-Networks-Architectures
Implements and compares the following models on CIFAR dataset:

– Single-layer Perceptron (Linear Classifier)
– Shallow MLP
– Deep MLP
– Deep MLP with ReLU
– CNN
– CNN with Dropout
– Deep CNN (VGG-style)
– Residual Network (ResNet)

Each script under code has the model, traning, validation phase and the generated plots are in the image dir
